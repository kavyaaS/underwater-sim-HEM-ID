  This Unreal Engine 5.3.2-based simulator models an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV)
  environment used for studying Intelligent Human Error Mitigation (HEM-ID) in teleoperation.
  The simulation was developed and tested on Windows, with realistic buoyancy physics and Lumen-based lighting. It serves as the 
  experimental environment for the ACM THRI paper on Intelligent Disobedience in teleoperated tasks.
