# Underwater-sim-HEM-ID
The simulator models an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV), BlueROV, for navigation tasks.   Participants teleoperate the ROV through different challenges that can lead to human-induced errors (mistakes, slips, and lapses).

### 🐠 Full Simulation Overview

Full video of the gameplay is present in `/full_gameplay_base_level.mp4`. This video shows the underwater teleoperation task, where the ROV navigates through the ring-collection course under varying visibility and depth conditions.

## Quick start
1. Open the `base_level.uproject` in UE 5.3.2.
2. Open **`VehicleTemplate/Maps/vehicleExampleMap.umap`**.
3. Download the required assets and materials through UE. See **`Docs/Add-Assets.md`** and the list in **`Docs/Required_Assets.csv`**.
4. **First run only:** `Build → Build All Levels` → **Save All**, then reopen the map.
5. Press **Play**.


## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|-----------|
| **W** | Ascend (up) |
| **S** | Descend |
| **↑ Up Arrow** | Move forward |
| **↓ Down Arrow** | Move backward |
| **← / → Arrows** | Turn left / right |
| **V** | Toggle camera (first ↔ third person) — press twice to switch |
| **Esc** | End simulation (Quit PIE) |

> **Tip 1:** The vehicle spawns on the seabed. Ascend (**W**) first before moving forward; otherwise the robot remains embedded in the sand.  
> **Tip 2:** An upper-depth limit prevents surfacing above the water. If you reach it, upward motion stops.  
> **Tip 3:** The first time you open the project, select **Build → Build All Levels**, then **Save All**. If Unreal shows “4 Landscape actors need rebuild,” open **Landscape mode → Build All Landscapes** once.

## 🧠 Research context (THRI paper)

This simulator was the testbed for evaluating **Intelligent Disobedience (ID)** strategies in human–robot collaboration and this level was developed as the base (control) level with the three types of human-induced errors embedded in the simulation. The idea was to use this testbed to study the different ID strategies to mitigate the human-induced errors through a wizard-of-oz experiment approach.

Participants completed timed ring-collection tasks under varying visibility and environmental conditions.  
Data collected included task completion time, collision count, NASA-TLX workload, MDMT trust, and acceptance ratings. Please refer to the paper for more information:
